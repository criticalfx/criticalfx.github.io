1. Inspired by critical design, *critical effects* (CFX) is a new field of study which takes a critical theory-based approach to cinematic postproduction including areas like visual effects, color grading, and sound design. 

2. CFX challenges the presumptions about effects and doesn't consider them decoration (ie. something extra) â€“ effects are structural elements (ie. something innate), they are *primitives of style* in the sense Susan Sontag wrote about style in her essays. Effects are an expression of the technology behind an artwork, they reflect the means involved in the production.

3. Focusing on both academic and artistic research, CFX uses speculative proposals to rethink conceptions about the role that *effects* currently have in film production and consumption. 

4. Just as futurism and surrealism appropriated forms of popular entertainment, CFX aims to take from blockbuster movies but at the same time cover the full scope of cinematic experiences, from continuity editing and *the cinema of affordance* to weird embodiment and radical experimental film. 

5. CFX does not emphasize the commercial utility of audiovisual trickery. It is mainly used to share a critical perspective or inspire debate while increasing awareness of social, cultural, or ethical issues in the eyes of the public. CFX should help us *see effects*.

6. CFX is a work in progress currently being developed by [Franz Milec](http://franzmilec.com).
