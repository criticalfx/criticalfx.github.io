<h1>CFX â€“ The <i>Critical Effects</i> Manifesto</h1>

<p>1. Inspired by critical design, <i>critical effects</i> (CFX) is a new field of study which takes a critical theory based approach to visual effects and sound design in the context of cinematic postproduction. Focusing on both academic and artistic research, CFX uses speculative proposals to challenge assumptions and conceptions about the role that effects currently have in film production and consumption.</p>

<p>2. CFX does not emphasize the commercial utility of audiovisual trickery. It is mainly used to share a critical perspective or inspire debate while increasing awareness of social, cultural, or ethical issues in the eyes of the public.</p>

<p>3. CFX covers the full scope of cinematic experiences, from continuity editing and <i>cinema of affordance</i> to weird embodiment and radical experimental film.</p>

<p>4. CFX is a work in progress currently being developed by <a href="https://franzmilec.com">Franz Milec</a>.</p>
